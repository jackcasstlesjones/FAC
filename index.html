        Hi, I'm Jack! A web developer, climber and traveler who is looking to

          <p id="info-one">
            In 2021, I made the crazy choice of moving to Thailand with my
            partner mid-COVID to teach English in public schools in Bangkok. In
            my teaching schedule, there were several hours of every day where I
            had to be in school but had no marking or teaching to do. Having
            messed around with FreeCodeCamp before, I got stuck into some Udemy
            tutorials and the rest is history!

          <h2 id="header-two">Why Coding?</h2>
          <p id="info-two">
            All my life I have experienced excess amounts of energy, fixations
            with certain topics, activities or foods, and an unwavering interest
            in the world around me. In 2022 my girlfriend suggested that I go
            forward with an ADHD diagnosis. Due to the extreme burden on the
            NHS, this is something I am still on a waiting list for. The
            prospect that I am neurodivergent has impacted me massively. From
            the self-forgiveness of "weird" behaviour or fixations, to being
            able to understand why I can become so stressed with an
            over-abundance of tasks (or lack of them!!), it has had a
            significant impact on my understanding of my own mental health.

          <p id="info-four">
            I love my brain. I love that I can focus intensely on one topic or
            long term goal. I genuinely see it as a superpower. However, there
            are many times when I am overloaded and I struggle to cope. As a
            result, I tend to seek out activities that encourage deep focus and
            a state of flow. One of these is rock climbing. When I am moving on
            rock, the volume of my thoughts is turned down to zero and I am
            living purely in the moment. The same happens when I am struggling
            to find a particular solution to a problem in coding, and the
            problem solving aspect of both rock climbing and coding has brought
            me so much joy since I began both of them three years ago.
